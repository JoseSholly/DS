    "## Problem Description: Leather Bag Manufacturing and Transportation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\"Kaefi Leather Bags Inc.\" is a renowned company specializing in manufacturing high-end leather bags. As part of its supply chain operations, the company needs to optimize the transportation of leather bags from its production facilities to various retail stores. However, the transportation costs are influenced by changing attributes of the leather bags, such as their value, fragility, fuel price,and regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "We are tasked with designing a transportation model for \"Kaefi Leather Bags Inc.\" that takes into account the changing attributes of leather bags and determines the most cost-effective transportation plan. The attributes to be considered include the value of the bags, their fragility, and the need for special handling due to regulatory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Given Data\n",
    "1. **Supply Nodes**: Production facilities of \"Kaefi Leather Bags Inc.\" located in different regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demand Nodes**: Retail stores and boutiques where the leather bags need to be delivered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Commodities**: Various types of leather bags, each with a specific value, fragility level, and regulatory classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initial Transportation Costs**: The initial costs of transporting each type of leather bag from a production facility to a retail store, accounting for standard handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Changing Transportation Costs**: Updated transportation costs for each type of leather bag, considering factors such as increased costs for fragile items or additional requirements due to regulatory changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "The main objective is to minimize the total transportation cost while adapting to the changing attributes of leather bags.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "1. **Supply and Demand Balance**: The total number of each type of leather bag shipped from production facilities should meet the demand requirements of retail stores.\n",
