    "### **Problem Description: Transportation Optimization with Demand Variability and Increased Fuel Prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "A leather bag manufacturing company, operating from two factories: Factory1 and Factory2 based in Akure and Abeokuta respectively, aims to optimize its transportation plan to distribute leather travel bags to three retail stores  (Benin, Abuja, and Lagos). The company wants to minimize transportation costs while considering changes in demand variability among the stores and the impact of increased fuel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Function:**\n",
    "Minimize the total transportation costs while accounting for demand variability and increased fuel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variables:**\n",
    "- $x(i, j)$: Number of units of leather bags transported from Factory $i$ to Store $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "- $D_{j}$: Adjusted demand requirement for Store $j$ based on demand variability.\n",
    "- $C_{ij}$: Initial transportation cost to transport one unit from Factory $i$ to Store $j$.\n",
    "- *Increased Fuel Price*: Factor by which transportation costs are increased due to higher fuel prices.\n",
    "- $C_{ij}^{new}$: Updated transportation cost due to increased fuel prices for transporting one unit from Factory $i$ to Store $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "1. **Supply Capacity Constraints:**\n",
    "   - Total units shipped from each factory must not exceed the total supply capacity of leather bags at each factory:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $\\sum_{j} x[(i, j)] \\leq $ Supply Capacity $_{i}$, for $i$ in Supply Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demand Requirement Constraints:**\n",
    "   - Adjusted demand requirement must be met for each retail store based on demand variability:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; $\\sum_{j} x[(i, j)] \\leq D_{i}$, for $i$ in Supply Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Function:**\n",
    "Minimize the total transportation costs considering initial transportation costs and updated transportation costs due to increased fuel prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minimize: $\\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} C_{ij} \\times x[(i, j)] + \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} C_{ij}^{\\text{new}} \\times x[(i, j)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Status:**\n",
    "The problem will be solved using linear programming techniques to find the optimal transportation plan and associated total costs for both the initial and changing cost scenarios due to increased fuel prices. This Linear Programming problem formulation aims to optimize the transportation of leather bags while considering demand variability and increased fuel prices, ensuring efficient distribution while minimizing costs."
