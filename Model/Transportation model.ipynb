    "### **Problem Description: Transportation Optimization with Demand Variability and Increased Fuel Prices**\n",
    "\n",
    "A leather bag manufacturing company, operating from two factories (Factory1 and Factory2), aims to optimize its transportation plan to distribute leather bags to three retail stores (Store1, Store2, Store3). The company wants to minimize transportation costs while considering changes in demand variability among the stores and the impact of increased fuel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Function:**\n",
    "Minimize the total transportation costs while accounting for demand variability and increased fuel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Variables:**\n",
    "- \\(x[(i, j)]\\): Number of units of leather bags transported from Factory \\(i\\) to Store \\(j\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "1. **Supply Capacity Constraints:**\n",
    "    - The total number of units shipped from each factory must not exceed its supply capacity:\n",
    "    \\[ \\sum_{j} x[(i, j)] \\leq \\text{Supply Capacity}_i, \\text{ for } i \\in \\text{Supply Nodes} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Demand Requirement Constraints with Variability:**\n",
    "    - The total number of units delivered to each store should meet the demand requirement considering demand variability:\n",
    "    \\[ \\sum_{i} x[(i, j)] \\geq \\text{Demand Variability}_j \\times \\text{Base Demand}_j, \\text{ for } j \\in \\text{Demand Nodes} \\]\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Objective Function:**\n",
    "    - Minimize the total transportation costs:\n",
    "    \\[ \\text{Minimize:} \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} \\text{Initial Transportation Cost}_{(i, j)} \\times x[(i, j)] \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Constraints:**\n",
    "    - The decision variables \\(x[(i, j\n",
    "\n",
    ",)], the units of leather bags transported from Factory \\(i\\) to Store \\(j\\), must be non-negative integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Changing Transportation Costs due to Increased Fuel Prices:**\n",
    "    - Update the transportation costs to reflect the increased fuel prices:\n",
    "    \\[ \\text{New Transportation Cost}_{(i, j)} = \\text{Initial Transportation Cost}_{(i, j)} \\times \\text{Increased Fuel Price} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Objective Function with Changed Transportation Costs:**\n",
    "    - The updated objective function incorporates the changed transportation costs due to increased fuel prices:\n",
    "    \\[ \\text{Minimize:} \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} \\text{New Transportation Cost}_{(i, j)} \\times x[(i, j)] \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Solution:**\n",
    "    - The transportation optimization problem is solved to determine the optimal transportation plan that minimizes costs while considering demand variability and increased fuel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This problem formulation provides a high-level description of the transportation optimization problem, including the objective function and constraints equations. You can translate this worded description into mathematical equations for use in optimization solvers like PuLP."
