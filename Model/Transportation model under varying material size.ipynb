    "Transportation Problem: Optimizing Material Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are managing a construction supply company that needs to deliver different types of construction materials to various construction sites. Your goal is to minimize transportation costs while meeting demand and respecting the capacity of the delivery trucks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Materials:\n",
    "\n",
    "Lumber: Each unit requires 10 units of space.\n",
    "Steel Beam: Each unit requires 30 units of space.\n",
    "Cement Bags: Each unit requires 20 units of space.\n",
    "Trucks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Truck 1: Can carry up to 40 units of space.\n",
    "Truck 2: Can carry up to 50 units of space.\n",
    "You need to determine how many units of each material to load onto each truck in order to minimize the total amount of materials transported while ensuring that the demand for each material is met and the truck capacities are not exceeded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your objective is to find the optimal distribution of materials that minimizes the transportation cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supply equals demand: The sum of each material transported on all trucks must equal the demand for that material.\n",
    "Truck capacity: The sum of the product of each material's amount and size loaded on each truck must not exceed the truck's capacity.\n",
    "Your task is to develop an optimization model that assigns the materials to the trucks in a way that satisfies the constraints and minimizes the total transportation cost. This will help your company efficiently deliver materials to construction sites while optimizing resource utilization."
