    "A furniture manufacturing company produces three types of furniture: **chairs**, **tables**, and **cabinets**. Each product requires different amounts of raw materials and labor, and has varying profit margins. We want to determine the optimal production quantities for each item to maximize your profit while considering material availability and customer demand.\n",
